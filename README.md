Wireless Capsule Endoscopy (WCE) is a non-invasive medical imaging technology that allows
the visualization of the digestive tract using a small, swallowable capsule equipped with a
camera. In this project, we focus on a dataset comprising of WCE images, aiming to distinguish
between bleeding and non-bleeding images. Early and accurate detection of bleeding conditions
can lead to improved diagnosis and more effective treatment. By leveraging feature extraction
techniques and ensemble machine learning models, this project aims to enhance the accuracy and
reliability of bleeding detection in WCE images.
